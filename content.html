            <h1>Wake Up</h1>
            <img src="a.jpg" class="image" alt="Unemployment">
            <p>Do you live in the countryside? Are your neighbors employed? I also live in the countryside and
            there I can see my neighbors sitting on their rears the whole day. My neighbors have loads of debts and
            most importantly they have lots of mouth they have to feed. Sadly, the male members only goes to work
            because of traditional views. Most of them are farmers, and some are workers for various industries like
            construction. However, their wages were never enough. </p>
            <p>Their works don’t have steady incomes and it is hard to get a job that has a steady income. A job that is proper needs an employee who has an educational background. Many businessmen think that hiring people with no educational background can make other people think that they are not worth to become business allies. Even though people that have no educational background have skills, employers still think of them as dumb. So why allow employers choose employees based on educational background? In this way, our economy will rise.</p>
            <p>Another problem that many of us may have noticed is that women are left a home doing housework because they believe that a woman’s place is at the house. Most women still believes that a woman can only work if the work is connected to housework. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most women would just stay at home and just gossip. Most countries is suffering because of such traditional ideas. Even though other countries have accepted equality in gender, many people in our country are still discriminated according to their race. I say that we all go to work and all women must dress up as a man so that women can feed the mouth of her children.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, people are adapting new technology. Technology is seen everywhere and bit by bit technology replaces or lessens our work. In addition, robots is seen to be more convenient to businessmen and businessmen have replaced their workers with robots. Because of such acts, many people are disheartened to apply to any jobs. They think that they do not have the skills that a robot possesses. But I think it is time to change that because robots do not think but rather commanded. Our country needs workers who thinks so why not put all those robots and other technological advances in a trash bag.</p>
            <p>It is funny to say the least how people are so dumb because they care for traditions and what others might think. Instead of caring for those who relies on them, they are just sitting and doing nothing. Our country is in a state of slumber because its inhabitants think that everything is ok because they are still breathing. In contrast everything is not okay, people are dying because of hunger. Hunger caused by unemployment so I’m telling you now stand up and be persistent and do not wait for hunger to come. But remember, never ever use unemployment as an excuse to laziness.</p>
