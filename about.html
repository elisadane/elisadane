            <h2>My name is Elisa Dane D. Evangelista and I am a Filipino citizen. I am currently studying in highschool yet I'm still not sure what course to take. Nevertheless, I was born in a rural area and I have lots of neighbors who were less fortunate. If they are short in cash, they would borrow money from "bumbays" or "5/6". Even though they are short in cash, my neighbors had bad habits of smoking, drinking, and gambling. Not like more fortunate people, my neighbors inheritance from their ancestors are debts. I have chosen this topic for my esssay because I want to spread awareness about the grave situation of our nation. We lack perseverance and we chose being lazy than working their rears off to pay for the debt so that their children would not inherit debts. Moreover, I can understand their situation because both of my grandparents from my mother anf father side does poor work. My father's side are all farmers and my mother's are all fishermen and sailors. Due to the desire of helping their parents and brothers and sisters, both of my parents have gone abroad. The scariest thing is that going abroad is not a bed of roses but a path full of thorns. My father and mother had help their families a lot and here we are. I can say that being the eldest child of the family means you have to be strong for your family. My dad had sacrificed his time of watching us grow up from a baby so that we could study. I believe that there is hope that our debts would be paid off and I have hope that the less fortunate would be more-openminded. We can plant hope to anyone around us so they can push forward. I remember someone telling me that the during the after the rainy days are the sunny days.</h2>
